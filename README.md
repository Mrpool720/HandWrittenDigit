This Python code trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition. Below is a breakdown of the code's functionality: <br>

ðŸ‘‰Imported Libraries:<br>
numpy: For numerical computations.<br>
tensorflow and keras: For building and training neural networks.<br>
keras.datasets: Provides access to the MNIST dataset.<br>
keras.models.Sequential: Allows creating a sequential model by stacking layers.<br>
keras.layers: Contains layers for building the neural network.<br>
tensorflow.keras.utils.to_categorical: Converts class vectors to binary class matrices.<br>
keras.backend: Provides functions to interact with backend implementations.<br>
ðŸ‘‰Loading the MNIST Dataset:<br>

Loads the MNIST dataset using mnist.load_data() and splits it into training and testing sets (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test).<br>
Prints the shapes of training and testing data arrays.<br>
Preprocessing Data:<br>

Reshapes the input data arrays to have a shape suitable for CNN input ((28, 28, 1)).<br>
Normalizes the input data by dividing by 255 (to scale pixel values between 0 and 1).<br>
Converts class vectors to binary class matrices (one-hot encoding) using to_categorical.<br>
ðŸ‘‰Building the CNN Model:<br>

Constructs a sequential model using Sequential().<br>
Adds Convolutional layers (Conv2D), ReLU activation, max-pooling layers (MaxPooling2D), and dropout layers (Dropout).<br>
Flattens the output from convolutional layers to feed into densely connected layers (Dense).<br>
Compiles the model using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adadelta optimizer.<br>
ðŸ‘‰Training the Model:<br>

Trains the model using model.fit() on the training data.<br>
Specifies batch size, number of epochs, and validation data.<br>
Prints the success message after training.<br>
ðŸ‘‰Saving the Model:<br>

Saves the trained model to a file named 'mnist.h5' using model.save().<br>
ðŸ‘‰Evaluating the Model:<br>

Evaluates the model's performance on the test data using model.evaluate().<br>
ðŸ‘‰Prints the test loss and accuracy.<br>
This code essentially creates, trains, and evaluates a CNN model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, and then saves the trained model for later use.
